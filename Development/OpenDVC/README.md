# Modified Version of the OpenDVC based on

- Hierarchical Learned Video Compression (HLVC) (**CVPR 2020**) [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01966)] [[Codes](https://github.com/RenYang-home/HLVC)]

- Recurrent Learned Video Compression (RLVC) (**IEEE J-STSP 2021**) [[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9288876/)] [[Codes](https://github.com/RenYang-home/RLVC)]

# OpenDVC -- An open source implementation of the DVC Video Compression Method

An open source Tensorflow implementation of the paper:

> Lu, Guo, *et al.* "DVC: An end-to-end deep video compression framework." *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*. 2019.

The original DVC method is only optimized for PSNR. In our OpenDVC codes, we provide the **PSNR-optimized** re-implementation, denoted as OpenDVC (PSNR), and also the **MS-SSIM-optimized** model, denoted as OpenDVC (MS-SSIM).
